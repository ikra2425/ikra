<p>Hi, I’m Codey! I’m a web developer in Hot Beans. As an experienced web developer with 5+ years of experience in creating dynamic, responsive websites and web application using modern frameworks  and technologies. Skilled in front-end , back end and data base management. Being a senior worker I manage everything from website navigation and layout to a company’s web hosting and security architecture. My expertise lies within front-end web apps, and the main languages in my tech stack are JavaScript, React, and of course HTML/CSS. I’m a lifelong learner (currently taking a course on building AI chatbots with Python!) and love to read, run, and find new bubble tea shop in London</p>
